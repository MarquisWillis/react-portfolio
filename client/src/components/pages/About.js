            <p>
                Hello! I am an aspiring full-stack developer, with strong problem solving and adaptability skills. 
                Finding efficiencies in performance and optimization across the board is something I genuinely love and constantly strive for. 
                Working with other collaborators on large scale projects to not only add, but improve already existing technoligies is an enticing experience that I am able to perform at my highest capacity. 
            </p>
